# chicken

This game was made for an AI class.

The agent must return C or D. If both agents play C, they are each awarded 2 points, if both play D, neither player gets points.
If one plays C and the other plays D, the one that plays D gets 3 points and the other gets 1.

If you would like to create your own agent, just create a file in the same directory containing a function that begins with "ichAgent" follwed by your chosen agent name.

To build and run the simulation, enter the following commands from the command line:

```
nice bash ichBuild.bash
nice ./ichRunSim
```
